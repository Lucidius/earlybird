    <h1> About</h1>
    <p> In 1976 Early Bird Contractors was born. What started as a few brothers trying to achieve their dream of owning their own company has become a legacy of service. From large commercial projects to segments of a yard, Early Bird has the knowledge, manpower, and equipment to get the job done.  We are proud of our service of Southeast Idaho, and look forward to many more years to come.</p>

    <p> Early Bird Contractors is a full service landscaping company. From initial earthwork to landscaped beds Early Bird gets the job done right.  With 35 years of experience we have seen a great deal of things that do not work for the homeowner. Because of this experience we provide quality solutions, at reasonable prices, with minimal maintenance.</p>
    
    <p> We look forward to adding your story to our legacy of service.</p>
